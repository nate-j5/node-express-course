Notes
- This project imports a package that handles all the async errors for us 
- When you throw an error with the async errors package -> throwing an error does this for us
- Worked on the database connection and schema | populate.js
- Exit out of the populate file once populate runs - its purpose is just to add values to mongo
- Dynamic filtering in the products controller
- How to extract the specific parameter you want for a specific route 
- Using regex to create dynamic search when looking for values
- sort values alphabatically (or by other measures)
- sort by multiple values | 4:26
- Insert a default value of sort isn't part of query parameter
- Only display certian fields in the API response based on query parameter
- Give user ability to limit number of records 
- Setup pagination query params
- Numeric Fitlering
